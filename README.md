I treated this as a client project. It’s important to make design decisions that not only make applications modern and beautiful but to also solve problems.

**Problem**

An online newspaper company “Good News” wanted to update their website. Due to world events (Coronavirus), many customers felt stressed and anxious reading their articles. Good News was losing readership. Good News wanted to ensure their current customers were staying happy and continued subscribing.

Customer addressed the following concerns with their current website:

-   Too many articles on one page

-   Home page was overwhelming, confusing customers

-   Articles felt “stacked on top of each other"

**Goals**

Improve the design to address the main concerns.

**Approach**

Design Decisions:

-   Use Sans-serif fonts

-   Rounded borders

-   Professional, friendlier color palette

-   Good use of whitespace

-   Use of visuals (images) to display hierarchy/importance

-   Clean, Modern UI (CSS Grid)

-   Mobile Friendly

-   Articles on the home page were only shown if you asked for that section

**Results**

I ended up with a clean and stylish website design, good “white space” utilization and attention to detail which allow to attract the target audience in a more efficient way.

**My Philosophy**

As a Software Engineer, I have a gift that can affect people globally. The Coronavirus inspired me to make these design decisions to do what I can to make a company’s site better and more impactful. While this was a fictitious client project I believe we have a responsibility to make the world better than yesterday.

**NOTES**

The app works in Chrome, Safari, Mobile Chrome, and Mobile Safari. At the last second, I noticed a React Router bug in Firefox preventing `location.state` persisting. I believe this is an actual bug with the React Router since the behavior works as expected across all other browsers.

I made sure to test on Safari to make up for a lost browser :)
